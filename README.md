# Cpp Primer_Notes
notes of book C++ Primer

## compiling a C++ program:
By default, the command to run the GNU compiler is g++:

`g++ -o prog1 prog1.cc`

The -o prog1 is an argument to the compiler and names the file in which to put the executable file. This command generates an executable file named prog1 or prog1.exe, depending on the operating system. Compilers usually include options to generate warnings about problematic constructs. It is usually a good idea to use these options. Our preference is to use -Wall with the GNU compiler, and to use /W4 with the Microsoft compilers.
