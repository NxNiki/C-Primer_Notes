# Cpp Primer_Notes
notes of book C++ Primer

## compiling a C++ program:
By default, the command to run the GNU compiler is g++:

`g++ -o prog1 prog1.cc`
The -o prog1 is an argument to the compiler and names the file in which to put the executable file. This command generates an executable file named prog1 or prog1.exe, depending on the operating system.
